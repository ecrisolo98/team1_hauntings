                  To answer the question <span class="question_element">“Over Which Years and Months Were Haunted Sightings in States Most Common”</span>, we made
                  a <span class="chart_type">Heatmap</span> with years on the x axis and months on the y axis. The colors range from white to light pink 
                  to darker pinks to purples, representing more bigfoot sightings with each shade getting darker. Therefore, the heatmap shows us for example 
                  that the 2000s were a particularly busy year for bigfoot sightings with mostly
                  purple rectangles in the heatmap. In contrast, the 1940s for example was a decade with far fewer sightings across the months.
